// Pre-processes a markdown string so that GitHub-style alert blockquotes
// render as coloured callouts in the in-app Help tab.
//
// The docs use GitHub's alert syntax as their ONLY highlighting mechanism —
// there are no emoji section markers any more, so colour carries the weight
// that a 🚨 or ✅ used to:
//
//     > [!CAUTION]     red     — warnings; something can break or cost money
//     > [!WARNING]     orange  — notices; a caveat worth reading before acting
//     > [!TIP]         green   — streamlined; a thing that got easier or faster
//     > [!NOTE]        blue    — neutral aside
//     > [!IMPORTANT]   purple  — load-bearing detail that is easy to miss
//
// Why a transform rather than styling <blockquote> directly: GitHub renders
// this syntax natively with exactly these colours, so the same .md file is
// already correct when read on github.com. Neither react-markdown nor
// remark-gfm implements it, though — there, `> [!CAUTION]` degrades to an
// ordinary grey blockquote whose first line reads "[!CAUTION]". Rewriting the
// block into a <div class="docs-alert …"> recovers the colour in-app without
// adding a dependency.
//
// Why <div class> specifically: DocsViewer sanitises raw HTML through
// SAFE_HTML_SCHEMA, which allows `class` on div (and on details/summary) and
// on nothing else. A <span style="color:red"> would be silently stripped of
// its style and render as flat text — so div+class is not a stylistic
// preference here, it is the only thing that survives the sanitiser.
//
// The static site generator applies the same rewrite; the two are kept in
// sync by docsAlerts.test.ts, which asserts both produce the same class names.
